HOW TO RUN THE CODE
===================

1. Place a dataset in the project folder


2. Go into the proj_input.txt file. Adjust the parameters to reflect the files you want to map. It's format is as such:

[original java file's file path]
[File name of XML file to be generated (e.g. test_1)]
[integer n to specify number of versions being compared (e.g. 2)]
[original java file's file path]
[version 2 of original java file]
[version 3 of original java file]
.
.
.
[version n of original java file]


3. Go into the project folder in the terminal using "cd"


4. Run the .bat file (which uses the parameters of proj_input.txt) in the terminal to map the lines and generate the XML file with the line mappings.


5. The XML file should be in the project folder, with the correct line mappings for each version
